CSModeling is a discrete event modeling system, includes:
	Event monitor (files lib.*): functions simulate, schedule, cancel, clear_cal, setproc, setname, setpars
	Model events, main program: model.c, model.h
	Model configuration files: model.conf, conf.*
	Statistic computing: stat.c, stat.h
	makefile

First commit has breaking task queue in model.c; needs to rewrite it.
Initially CSModeling is a course work by Simulation Modeling.
